# Books vs Movies Data Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze, **How many best selling books were made into movies**. Our reasoning for choosing this topic is because we wanted to analyze something that is fun and everyone can relate to.

Additional questions:
2. How many Books have been made into Movies vs series?
3. How many Books have been made into Movies have won awards?
